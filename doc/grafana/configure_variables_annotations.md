# Configure Grafana variables and annotations

## Prerequisites

* You have set up a Grafana dashboard, see [here](configure_dashboard.md).

## Create variables

You can create variables for Metric Ids like Digitalstrom rooms, groups, color or for Netatmo modules. Those can be used in dashboard panel queries or in annotation queries. For more information on this topic, see the [Grafana variables documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/reference/templating/).

**Example:**

## Create annotations

Annotations can be created for displaying non-equidistant data of the GraphIoT application, like Digitalstrom events.

**Example:**

Annotations can contain Grafana variables (see above).

Annotation queries must follow this JSON pattern (`event_names`, `group_ids` and `scene_ids` are mandatory):

```json
{
  "event_names": [ "callScene" ],
  "meter_ids": [ "a8fe..2d45" ],
  "zone_ids": [ 5, 10, 31071 ],
  "group_ids": [ 0, 1, 2 ],
  "scene_ids": [ 1, 5 ]
}
```

### Detailled description
