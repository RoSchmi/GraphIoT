# SonnenClient

SonnenClient is a .NET Core class library with a wrapper for the [Sonnen Portal](https://account.sonnen.de/) RESTful JSON interface. It encapsulates all authentication, retry and parsing logic and provides a strongly typed method interface.

## NuGet

```powershell
PM> Install-Package PhilipDaubmeier.SonnenClient
```

## Usage

You have to implement the interface `ISonnenConnectionProvider` to provide the `SonnenPortalClient` with all information necessary to authenticate at the API and establish a connection or use the existing `SonnenConnectionProvider`.

The minimal viable example for playing around with the client would be as follows:

```csharp
var sonnenConnProvider = new SonnenConnectionProvider(
    authData: new SonnenAuth("<username>", "<password>"),
    clientId: "<client_id>"
);
```

> **Caution:** in a productive use you may want to implement your own `ISonnenConnectionProvider` and load your client id from a suitable vault and the user credentials should be entered by the user in some way and immediatelly discarded again. The `ISonnenAuth` object will contain a refresh token that can be used to re-authenticate at any time, which can be persisted by implementing a custom `ISonnenAuth` class. You can have a look at the respective classes in [`GraphIoT.Sonnen`](../GraphIoT.Sonnen/Config) as an example.

If you have the connection provider in place, you can create a `SonnenPortalClient` and query for battery info and measurements:

```csharp
var sonnenClient = new SonnenPortalClient(sonnenConnProvider);
            
// get the default Sonnen battery site
var siteId = (await sonnenClient.GetUserSites()).DefaultSiteId;

// get the first battery of this site
var battery = (await sonnenClient.GetBatterySystems(siteId)).First();
Console.WriteLine($"Charge cycles: {battery.BatteryChargeCycles}");

// get statistics
var stats = await sonnenClient.GetStatistics(siteId, DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1), DateTime.Now);
Console.WriteLine($"Produced energy (last 24h): {stats.ProducedEnergy}");

// get high resolution measurements and print the last 10 values of the time series
var graph = await sonnenClient.GetEnergyMeasurements(siteId, DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1), DateTime.Now);
var productionWattGraph = graph.ProductionPower;
Console.WriteLine($"Production power: {string.Join(',', productionWattGraph.TakeLast(10))}");
```

## Platform Support

CompactTimeSeries is targeted for .NET Standard 2.1 or higher.
