# DigitalstromTwin

DigitalstromTwin is a class library providing a DigitalstromDssTwin object as the main class, that automatically synchronizes scene states of all rooms both ways, i.e. if a state is changed programatically it sends a command to the DSS, if a scene is changed within the apartement the event is synched into the twin model.

## NuGet

```powershell
PM> Install-Package PhilipDaubmeier.DigitalstromTwin
```

## Usage

You have to implement the interface `IDigitalstromConnectionProvider` to provide the `DigitalstromDssTwin` with all information necessary to authenticate at the API and establish a connection, or use the default implementation `DigitalstromConnectionProvider`. See [DigitalstromClient usage documentation](../DigitalstromClient/README.md) for an example of this.

Having a connection provider, you can create a `DigitalstromDssTwin` and use it like:

```csharp
// Create the twin
var dssTwin = new DigitalstromDssTwin(connProvider);

// Get notified by events if something changed on the DSS
dssTwin.CollectionChanged += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine("New room detected");
dssTwin.SceneChanged += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine($"Scene in zone {e.Zone}, " + 
                                    $"group {e.Group} was changed to {e.Scene}");

Zone zoneKitchen = 5;

// Read the last called scene by simply using the indexer operator
var kitchenLightScene = dssTwin[zoneKitchen, Color.Yellow];

// Call a scene on the DSS by just setting the desired value on the twin
dssTwin[zoneKitchen, Color.Yellow].Value = SceneCommand.Preset2;
```

For more usage examples you can also have a look at the [unit tests](../../test/DigitalstromTwin.Tests).
