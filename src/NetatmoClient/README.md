# NetatmoClient

NetatmoClient is a .NET Core class library with a wrapper for the Netatmo Cloud RESTful JSON web service. It encapsulates all authentication, retry and parsing logic and provides a strongly typed method interface of the Netatmo API.

## NuGet

```powershell
PM> Install-Package PhilipDaubmeier.NetatmoClient
```

## Usage

You have to implement the interface `INetatmoConnectionProvider` to provide the `NetatmoWebClient` with all information necessary to authenticate at the API and establish a connection or use the existing `NetatmoConnectionProvider`.

The minimal viable example for playing around with the client would be as follows:

```csharp
var netatmoAuth = new NetatmoAuth("<username>", "<password>");
var netatmoConnProvider = new NetatmoConnectionProvider(netatmoAuth)
{
    AppId = "<your_netatmo_connect_app_id>",
    AppSecret = "<your_netatmo_connect_app_secret>",
    Scope = "read_station read_presence access_presence"
};
```

> **Caution:** in a productive use you may want to implement your own `INetatmoConnectionProvider` and load your app id and secret from a suitable vault and the user credentials should be entered by the user in some way and immediatelly discarded again. The `INetatmoAuth` object will contain a refresh token that can be used to re-authenticate at any time, which can be persisted by implementing a custom `INetatmoAuth` class. You can have a look at the respective classes in [`GraphIoT.Netatmo`](../GraphIoT.Netatmo/Config) as an example.

If you have the connection provider in place, you can create a `NetatmoWebClient` and query station data and measurements:

```csharp
var netatmoClient = new NetatmoWebClient(netatmoConnProvider);

// Find the id of the first base station of the logged in user
var weatherStation = await netatmoClient.GetWeatherStationData();
var baseStationId = weatherStation.Devices.First().Id;

// Get temperature values of the past 24 hours of the base station
var start = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1);
var end = DateTime.Now;
var measureTypes = new Measure[] { MeasureType.Temperature };
var measures = await netatmoClient.GetMeasure(baseStationId, baseStationId,
                     measureTypes, MeasureScale.Scale1Hour, start, end);

// Print out all values
foreach (var measure in measures.First().Value)
    Console.WriteLine($"timestamp: {measure.Key} temperature: {measure.Value} °C");
```
