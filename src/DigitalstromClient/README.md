# DigitalstromClient

DigitalstromClient is a .NET Core class library with a wrapper for the Digitalstrom Server (DSS) RESTful JSON interface. It encapsulates all authentication, retry and parsing logic and provides a strongly typed method interface of the DSS.

## NuGet

```powershell
PM> Install-Package PhilipDaubmeier.DigitalstromClient
```

## Usage

You have to implement the interface `IDigitalstromConnectionProvider` to provide the `DigitalstromDssClient` with all information necessary to authenticate at the API and establish a connection, or use the default implementation `DigitalstromConnectionProvider`.

The minimal viable example for playing around (do not hardcode credentials in real use!) with the client would be as follows:

```csharp
var uri = new Uri("https://dss.local:8080");

// The issued token will be visible in the DSS configurator with the name "SampleAppId"
var credentials = new EphemeralDigitalstromAuth("SampleAppId", "<username>", "<password>");

// Create a connection provider with dss uri and credentials, accept any certificate
var connProvider = new DigitalstromConnectionProvider(uri, () => credentials, cert => true);
```

> **Caution:** In productive use you may want to let the user enter his credentials in some way and immediatelly discard them again. The `IDigitalstromAuth` object will contain an application token that can be used to refresh the session token at any time, which can be persisted by implementing a custom `IDigitalstromAuth` class. You can have a look at the respective classes in [`GraphIoT.Digitalstrom`](../GraphIoT.Digitalstrom/Config) as an example how this could look like.

> **Caution:** in productive use you may want to let the user check the certificate fingerprint at first use and store this for later certificate pinning, only accepting this exact certificate to detect MITM attempts. The certificate validation callback of `DigitalstromConnectionProvider` can be used for this purpose.

If you have the connection provider, you can create a `DigitalstromDssClient` and query the DSS for data:

```csharp
// Create the client
var dssClient = new DigitalstromDssClient(connProvider);

// Load all zones and their last called scenes
var lastCalledScenes = await dssClient.GetZonesAndLastCalledScenes();
foreach (var zone in lastCalledScenes.Zones)
{
    var yellowScene = zone.Groups.First(g => g.Group == Color.Yellow).LastCalledScene;
    Console.WriteLine($"zone id {zone.ZoneID} has yellow group scene: {yellowScene.ToDisplayString()}");
}
```

For more usage examples you can also have a look at the [unit tests](../../test/DigitalstromClient.Tests).
