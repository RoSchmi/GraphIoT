# ViessmannClient

This class library provides a way to call the Viessmann Platform API. It encapsulates all authentication, retry and parsing logic and provides a strongly typed method interface for reading all details of an installation as well as all setting and sensor values of devices.

## NuGet

```powershell
PM> Install-Package PhilipDaubmeier.ViessmannClient
```

## Usage

You have to implement the interfaces `IViessmannAuth` and `IViessmannConnectionProvider<T>` to provide the Viessmann webservice clients with all information necessary to authenticate and establish a connection.

The minimal viable example for playing around (do not hardcode credentials in real use!) with the client would be to create a connection provider as shown here:

```csharp
var viessmannConnProvider = new ViessmannConnectionProvider<ViessmannPlatformClient>()
{
    AuthData = new ViessmannAuth("<username>", "<password>"),
    PlattformApiClientId = "<clientId>",
    PlattformApiClientSecret = "<clientSecret>"
};
```

> **Caution:** in a productive use you may want to implement your own `IViessmannConnectionProvider<T>` and load your app id, secret and user credentials from a suitable vault. You can have a look at the respective classes in [`GraphIoT.Viessmann`](../GraphIoT.Viessmann/Config) as an example for `IViessmannAuth` and `IViessmannConnectionProvider<T>` implemenations with secrets injection and storing/loading of access tokens.

If you have the connection providers in place, you can create and use the Viessmann client like this:

```csharp
var client = new ViessmannPlatformClient(viessmannConnProvider);

// Get the first installation, gateway and device id of the logged in user
var installationId = (await client.GetInstallations()).First().LongId;
var gatewayId = (await client.GetGateways(installationId)).First().LongId;
var deviceId = (await client.GetDevices(installationId, gatewayId)).First().LongId;

// Get sensor values
var features = await client.GetDeviceFeatures(installationId, gatewayId, deviceId);
var outsideTemp = features.GetHeatingSensorsTemperatureOutside();
var boilerTemp = features.GetHeatingBoilerTemperature();
Console.WriteLine($"Outside temp: {outsideTemp} °C, boiler temp: {boilerTemp} °C");

// Query for properties of individual circuits
foreach (var circuit in features.GetHeatingCircuits())
    Console.WriteLine($"Name of {circuit}: {features.GetHeatingCircuitsCircuitName(circuit)}");
```

For more usage examples you can also have a look at the [unit tests](../../test/ViessmannClient.Tests).

A full list of status and sensor values of devices can be found in the [`DeviceFeatureList`](Model/Devices/DeviceFeatureList.cs) class.
