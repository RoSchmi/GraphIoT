# CompactTimeSeries

CompactTimeSeries is an in-memory time series library for space-efficient storing, processing, resampling and compressing of time series data.

## NuGet

```powershell
PM> Install-Package PhilipDaubmeier.CompactTimeSeries
```

## When should I use it?

If you need to deal with mostly equidistant time series with a large number of values, e.g. sensor readings that are equally spaced in time, and need to process them in memory. The main classes of this library, which implement `ITimeSeries<T>` allow for convenient random access read/write to a time series via time-based indexers.

If you need fast persisting/loading of such time series data, this library will not help you - just use a [time series database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database#List_of_time_series_databases) like Influx, Graphite, CrateDB etc.

## Usage

```csharp
// Create a time series for today with 1 second spacing, which will result in 86400 values
var span = new TimeSeriesSpan(DateTime.Now.Date, DateTime.Now.Date.AddDays(1), TimeSeriesSpan.Spacing.Spacing1Sec);
var timeseries = new TimeSeriesStream<int>(span);

// Write to the time series via time-based indexer: the time bucket for the current second will be written
timeseries[DateTime.Now] = 42;

// Enumerate the time series values and timestamps like an IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<DateTime, T?>>
foreach (var timestampedValue in timeseries)
    DoSomething(timestampedValue);
```

For more usage examples you can also have a look at the unit tests.

## Platform Support

CompactTimeSeries is targeted for .NET Standard 2.1 or higher.
